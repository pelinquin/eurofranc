Democratic Cryptocurrency for 2015


To list all French "Mairies" I used a script to get village names/email from:
http://lannuaire.service-public.fr/navigation/index-mairie.html
and 'maire' name from the last 2014 elections from:
http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr

June 16th 2014, on 34234 matched lines, it remains 3400 villages without email !
Help us to fix them
